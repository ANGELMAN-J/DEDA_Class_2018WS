Description:       "Uses Markov Chains and LSTMs to generate new text in the style of some input corpus. Includes the weights for a pretrained LSTM model for Donald Trump tweets. Both techniques can in principle be used for any kind of natural language. The LSTM model should also be able to deal with highly structured text such as computer code - but that might require more nodes per layer and more training time. If you get an error, make sure you have both tensorflow installed and numpy upgraded to the latest version."
